## Commit 25c87ef5 - "Expand borrow checking coverage, fix 3 safety annotations"
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Author**: Shuai Mu

**Changes**: CMakeLists.txt (+2 files to borrow checking, +6 documented exclusions), server.h (AtomicFlag @safe→@unsafe), replication_helper.cc (set_replication_type @safe→@unsafe), recovery_manager.hpp (success_fresh @safe→@unsafe)

**Verdict**: No issues found (correct safety annotation fixes expanding borrow check coverage)

Good changes:
- All 3 annotation fixes are correct: `mutable std::atomic` (interior mutability), `std::cerr` (unchecked I/O), `std::string` construction (unchecked STL)
- 6 excluded files properly documented with violation counts from header code (not the source files themselves)
- Brings borrow-checked file count to 12

## Commit 754cc0b2 - "Fix CI test infrastructure: shebang, python3, borrow check"
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Author**: Shuai Mu

**Changes**: ci/ci.sh (shebang fix + python3), simple_transaction_rep_port_utils.sh (python3), masstree_key.hh (@safe→@unsafe annotation fix)

**Verdict**: No issues found (correct infrastructure fixes)

Good changes:
- Shebang fix: removed leading newline before `#!/bin/bash` in ci.sh that caused fallback to `sh` (which lacks process substitution)
- `python` → `python3` in 4 call sites across 2 files (necessary since `python` binary not available)
- `unparse_ikey()` correctly re-annotated from `@safe` to `@unsafe` since it calls `unparse()` which writes to raw buffer via `memcpy`

## Commit c253cc36 - "docs: add code-verified user manual"
**Date**: 2026-02-20
**Author**: Shuai Mu

## Commit db176a90 - "Fix 2 Raft async persistence bugs from commit 232ba3b0"
**Date**: 2026-02-10

**Changes**: server.cc (59 insertions, 22 deletions), server.h (29 insertions, 13 deletions)

**Verdict**: Two medium-severity issues found

### ISSUE-db176a90-1 (S2 medium): Mutex held during thread join in destructor
- Destructor holds `async_threads_mtx_` while calling `join()` on all threads
- If an in-flight RPC handler (past `stop_` check) tries to `emplace_back`, it deadlocks
- **Fix**: Swap vector out under lock, join without lock

### ISSUE-db176a90-2 (S2 medium): Unbounded thread handle accumulation
- `async_threads_` vector is append-only; completed thread handles never pruned
- Over thousands of operations, accumulates finished `std::thread` objects (minor resource leak)
- **Fix**: Prune completed threads (via atomic done flag) at each insertion

## Commit 232ba3b0 - "Zeyu raft disk (#53)"
**Date**: 2026-02-09
**Author**: Zeyu

Large commit adding Raft disk persistence with sync/async modes, speculative replication protocol, parallel heartbeat dispatch, atomic service pointer for kill/restart, and 21 new tests.

### ISSUE-232ba3b0-1 [S3 - high]
**Category**: Memory safety / use-after-free
**Evidence**: `src/deptran/raft/server.h` (doVote async path) and `src/deptran/raft/server.cc` (OnAppendEntries async path)
**Problem**: In the async persistence path, `std::thread(...).detach()` captures `this` (the `RaftServer*`). If the server is destroyed (e.g., during Kill/Restart in tests or shutdown) while the thread is running, the detached thread will access a dangling `this` pointer causing use-after-free. Example:
```cpp
std::thread([this, term_copy, voter_copy, can_id_copy, par_id_copy]() {
    PersistState(term_copy, can_id_copy, "doVote: async vote persist");
    auto c = commo();
    if (c != nullptr) {
        c->SendVoteDurable(can_id_copy, par_id_copy, term_copy, voter_copy);
    }
}).detach();
```
**Action**: Use `shared_from_this()` / weak references, or track spawned threads and join them in the destructor.

### ISSUE-232ba3b0-2 [S3 - high]
**Category**: Correctness / quorum logic
**Evidence**: `src/deptran/raft/server.cc` - `OnPeerRestart()` method
**Problem**: `durableVoters_` already contains `site_id_` (inserted during `ResetSpeculativeState()` and election win), but `OnPeerRestart()` computes `durable_vote_count = durableVoters_.size() + 1` adding another `+1` "for self". This double-counts self, making quorum checks off-by-one in the leader's favor. With 5 nodes (quorum=3), the leader could think it has 3 durable votes when it only has 2. Same issue for `specVoters_.size() + 1`.
**Action**: Remove the `+1` since self is already in the set, or verify the set doesn't contain self before adding.

## Commit 36e4f8ee - "Fix rpc_chaos_test CI flakiness and update daily checks"
**Date**: 2026-02-09

---

## Commit c84909cc - "Fix race condition in GetOrCreateClient causing intermittent segfault"

---

## Commit 31eda945 - "Update daily checks and add CI failure investigation"
**Date**: 2026-02-03

---

## Commit a6bed72c - "Reorganize documentation structure"
**Date**: 2026-02-03
**Author**: Shuai Mu

**Verdict**: No issues found (documentation reorganization only - no code changes)

Major cleanup moving docs to organized subdirectories (getting-started/, architecture/, developer/, rpc/, migration/, plans/, etc.). Removed stubs and outdated docs. Updated index.md navigation.

**CI Note**: Run #21649096526 failed with intermittent segfault in shardNoReplication test. Investigation shows this is NOT caused by this commit (no C++ changes). Test passes consistently locally (4/4 runs). The failure is an intermittent race condition in RrrRpcBackend::Stop during shutdown, likely triggered by CI environment timing.

## Commit 92c58460 - "Unify client-server interfaces with RunMode enum [issue-1.md]"
**Date**: 2026-01-25
**Author**: shenweihai1

**Verdict**: No issues found (clean API unification)

Good implementation:
- Added `ClientConfig` struct to `mako::Options` in db.hh with proper @safe annotations
- Added `RemoteDB::Connect(const Options&, int, RemoteDB**)` overload with comprehensive validation
- Properly deprecated `RemoteOptions` instead of removing it (backward compat)
- Added `RunMode` enum for cleaner mode handling in simpleTransactionRep.cc
- Clean delegation pattern: new API converts to old RemoteOptions internally
- Well-documented with usage examples in plan file

## Commit 33b02756 - "Unify IDatabase/ITable interfaces and consolidate client-server docs"
**Date**: 2026-01-21
**Author**: Shuai Mu

### ISSUE-33b02756-1 [S2 - medium]
**Category**: Docs / correctness
**Evidence**: `docs/client_server_architecture.md:100-104` claims txn_id encodes client_id (upper 32 bits) + per-client counter (lower 32 bits). Current server implementation uses `client_id` directly as `txn_id` in `src/mako/client_service.cc:65-68`.
**Problem**: Documentation describes a transaction ID scheme that is not implemented. This is already an open correctness gap in the RPC service and the doc makes it appear resolved.
**Action**: Either implement the documented txn_id encoding (per-client counter) or update docs to match current behavior and explicitly call out the limitation.
**Status**: Addressed by commit 7a6a5847

### ISSUE-33b02756-2 [S2 - medium]
**Category**: Implementation / partial implementation
**Evidence**: `examples/simpleTransactionRep.cc:894-969` still routes `--client` mode through a dedicated `run_client_mode` path and returns early, rather than reusing the unified IDatabase/ITable test path.
**Problem**: The change introduces IDatabase/ITable but does not actually remove the client-only code path or run the same test suite through the unified interface, leaving the original duplication and leaving client mode with only a demo flow.
**Action**: Refactor `main()` to construct an `IDatabase*` (local or remote) and run the same test flow for both modes, or document why client mode must remain separate.
**Status**: Addressed by commit 69f8ba0e

## Commit 1886cab7 - "Refactor client-server RPC from raw TCP sockets to RRR RPC framework"
**Date**: 2026-01-17
**Author**: shenweihai1

### ISSUE-1886cab7-1 [S3 - high]
**Category**: Implementation / partial implementation
**Evidence**: `src/mako/client_service.cc:65-72`
```cpp
// Generate transaction ID (same logic as ShardReceiver)
// Use client_id as the transaction ID since we're in single-client mode
// For multi-client support, we'd need a counter in receiver_
uint64_t txn_id = static_cast<uint64_t>(client_id);
```
**Problem**: `HandleBeginTxn` uses `client_id` directly as `txn_id`. In multi-client scenarios, if two clients have the same ID or call BeginTxn multiple times, transaction IDs will collide.
**Action**: Implement proper transaction ID generation using an atomic counter in `MakoClientService` or delegate to `ShardReceiver::begin_txn()`.
**Status**: Addressed by commit 7a6a5847

### ISSUE-1886cab7-2 [S3 - high]
**Category**: Implementation / not implemented
**Evidence**: `src/mako/client_service.cc:89-127`
```cpp
void MakoClientService::HandleCommit(...) {
    rrr::i64 txn_id;
    req->m >> txn_id;
    rrr::i32 status = ErrorCode::SUCCESS;  // Always returns SUCCESS!
    // No actual commit logic
}

void MakoClientService::HandleRollback(...) {
    // Same pattern - no actual rollback logic
}
```
**Problem**: `HandleCommit` and `HandleRollback` are no-ops that always return SUCCESS without performing any actual transaction management. Transaction state is never tracked or cleaned up.
**Action**: Either implement actual commit/rollback logic in `MakoClientService` or delegate to `ShardReceiver` methods that handle transaction state.
**Status**: Addressed by commit 844e6c99

### ISSUE-1886cab7-3 [S2 - medium]
**Category**: Testing / missing unit tests
**Evidence**: No unit tests found for `MakoClientService` in `test/` directory
**Problem**: New RPC service lacks dedicated unit tests. Only integration tests via CI scripts exist.
**Action**: Add unit tests for `MakoClientService` covering: BeginTxn ID generation, Put/Get/Delete operations, error handling paths, and concurrent client scenarios.
**Status**: Addressed by commit fb6d9d92

## Commit 131c2bff - "Implement full TCP-based client-server RPC for Mako"
**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Author**: shenweihai1

### ISSUE-131c2bff-1 [S2 - medium]
**Category**: Reinventing wheels
**Evidence**: `src/mako/lib/client_tcp_server.h` - Custom TCP server implementation
**Problem**: This commit introduced a custom TCP server that was later replaced by RRR RPC in commit 1886cab7. While this worked, it duplicated functionality that already existed in the RRR framework.
**Action**: N/A - Already addressed in subsequent commit 1886cab7.
**Status**: Addressed by commit 1886cab7

## Commit 6a5f8ad0 - "Implement client-server decoupling for Mako database"
**Date**: 2026-01-16
**Author**: shenweihai1

### ISSUE-6a5f8ad0-1 [S2 - medium]
**Category**: Implementation / partial implementation (by design)
**Evidence**: Commit message states: "Full RPC integration uses stub implementations - actual RPC communication will be added in a future iteration."
**Problem**: Initial commit was intentionally stub-only. Subsequent commits (131c2bff, 1886cab7) completed the implementation.
**Action**: N/A - Addressed in subsequent commits.
**Status**: Addressed by commits 131c2bff and 1886cab7
